#JavaScriptInTheBrowser-DOM-EventsFundamentalsProject2-ModalWindow
This is the second project of this section of the course.  This project will help me continue to develop a good understanding of using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM to make the web page dynamic.

This project gave me a more indepth look at using classes in JavaScript and DOM manipulation.  It also made me more comfortable creating addEventListeners and creating the functions for those events.  I even learned more about the 'keydown' event and using the 'e' (event) parameter in the function to determine which key was pressed on the keyboard.  Short but fun project!
